# Building Batch Data Analytics Solutions on AWS

In this guide, we'll explore how to build batch data analytics solutions using Amazon EMR (Elastic MapReduce). Amazon EMR is a cloud-based big data platform that allows you to process large datasets efficiently. We'll cover various modules to help you understand the key components and best practices for designing and implementing batch analytics solutions.

## Module 1: Introduction to Amazon EMR

### What is Amazon EMR?

Amazon EMR is a managed big data platform that simplifies the deployment and management of distributed data processing frameworks such as Apache Hadoop, Apache Spark, and Apache Hive. It allows you to process large amounts of data using scalable compute resources.

### Key Features of Amazon EMR:

- **Scalability**: EMR automatically scales resources based on workload requirements.
- **Managed Clusters**: EMR handles cluster provisioning, scaling, and termination.
- **Integration with AWS Services**: EMR integrates seamlessly with other AWS services like S3, DynamoDB, and Redshift.
- **Security and Access Control**: EMR provides security features such as encryption, IAM roles, and VPC integration.

### File system options with EMR

- HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System) - default file system for Hadoop-based workloads
- EMRFS (EMR File System) - allows EMR clusters to read and write data directly to Amazon S3

### Metadata storage solutions for Amazon EMR

- Internal metastore – By default, Hive records metastore information in a MySQL database on the primary node's file system. When a cluster terminates, all cluster nodes shut down, including the primary node. When this happens, local data is lost because node file systems use ephemeral storage.

- External Hive metastore – To use an external MySQL database or
  Amazon Aurora as your Hive metastore, you override the default configuration
  values for the metastore in Hive to specify the external database location,
  either on an Amazon RDS MySQL instance or an Amazon Aurora PostgreSQLinstance.

- AWS Glue Data Catalog – With Amazon EMR version 5.8.0 or later, you can
  configure Hive to use the AWS Glue Data Catalog as its metastore. This
  configuration meets requirements for a persistent metastore or a metastore
  shared by different clusters, services, applications, or AWS accounts. You
  AWS CLI or API, you use the configuration classification for Hive to specify
  the Data Catalog.

## Module 2: Data Analytics Pipeline Using Amazon EMR: Ingestion and Storage

### Data Ingestion:

- Use Amazon S3 to store raw data files.
- Set up EMR clusters to ingest data from S3 buckets.
- Consider using AWS Glue for ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) tasks.

### Data Storage:

- Leverage Amazon S3 for durable and scalable storage.
- Use EMRFS (EMR File System) for efficient data access from EMR clusters.

### Format Supported

#### What is Parquet?

Parquet is a columnar storage file format that provides efficient storage and encoding of data. It is designed to work well with complex data types and nested data structures, making it suitable for big data processing frameworks like Apache Spark and Apache Hive.

> Note imagine a table with 10k  columns, and you only need 50 columns, parquet will only read the 50 columns you need, and not the entire table, which is a huge performance gain.

### Data Compression

#### what to consider when choosing a compression format?

- storage cost
- bandwidth cost
- Compression ratio: The amount of compression achieved by the format.
- Compression speed: The time it takes to compress data.
- Decompression speed: The time it takes to decompress data.
- Compatibility with big data processing frameworks.








## Module 3: High-Performance Batch Data Analytics Using Apache Spark on Amazon EMR

### Spark on EMR: use cases

- ** Interactive Data Analysis**: Spark provides an interactive shell for ad-hoc data analysis and exploration.

- **ETL and Data Transformation**: Use Spark to process and transform large datasets for downstream analytics.

- **Machine Learning**: Leverage Spark's machine learning libraries for building and training predictive models.

- **Graph Processing**: Analyze and process graph data using Spark's graph processing capabilities.

### Apache Spark Overview:

- Spark is an open-source, in-memory data processing framework.
- EMR supports Spark for high-performance batch analytics.
- Use Spark for data transformation, machine learning, and graph processing.

### Benefits of Spark on EMR:

- **In-Memory Processing**: Spark utilizes in-memory caching for faster data processing.

- **Distributed Computing**: Spark distributes data processing tasks across a cluster of nodes.

- **Developer Productivity**: Spark provides high-level APIs for Python, Scala, and Java.


### Spark features on Amazon EMRo

- **EMRFS s3-optimized committer**: The EMRFS S3-optimized committer is a new output committer for Apache Spark that improves write performance when writing to S3. 

- **Spark web UI**: The Spark web UI is a web-based tool for monitoring and debugging Spark applications. You can use the Spark web UI to view information about your Spark application, such as the application's executors, jobs, stages, and tasks.


- **Aamazon EMR on EKS**: Amazon EMR on EKS is a deployment option for Amazon EMR that allows you to run Apache Spark on Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS). Amazon EMR on EKS runs the open-source big data frameworks on Amazon EKS to take advantage of the scalability, elasticity, and flexibility of Kubernetes.

- **AWS Glue Data Catalog**: The AWS Glue Data Catalog is a fully managed, Apache Hive-compatible metadata catalog that makes it easy to discover, prepare, and store data. The AWS Glue Data Catalog is used by AWS Glue to store table  which are
for Spark SQL queries, and is used by Amazon EMR to store table metadata for Spark SQL queries.


### Spark Components:
