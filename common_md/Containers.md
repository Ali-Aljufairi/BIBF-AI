# Sandboxing in Large Language Models (LLMs)

Sandboxing is a crucial security measure in LLMs that isolates the execution environment of AI-generated code. This prevents it from accessing critical systems or sensitive data, ensuring a secure and controlled space for running untrusted code.

## Key Aspects of LLM Sandboxing

### 1. Isolation
- Sandboxes use technologies like Docker to create separate environments where LLM-generated code runs safely without affecting the host system.

### 2. Multi-language Support
- Advanced sandboxing solutions, such as MPLSandbox, can detect and support multiple programming languages, making them flexible for various coding tasks.

### 3. Security Features
- Sandboxes enforce security measures like:  
  - **Resource constraints** (e.g., limiting memory usage and execution time)  
  - **Restricted access** to sensitive files and systems  
  - **Automated vulnerability detection** to identify risks before execution  

### 4. Code Analysis & Feedback
- Some sandboxes integrate code analysis tools that assess quality, performance, and potential vulnerabilities, helping developers refine LLM-generated code.

### 5. Easy Integration
- Sandboxing solutions are designed to seamlessly integrate into LLM workflows, making AI-driven coding safer without disrupting development processes.

## Why Sandboxing Matters
By properly implementing sandboxing techniques, developers can safely run LLM-generated code, reducing security risks and ensuring a controlled, protected execution environment.
