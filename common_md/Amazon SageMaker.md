> As  you saw that each  algorithm have it's on hyperparameter nobody can tell you the best hyperparameter for your model. So, you need to tune the hyperparameter to get the best model.


- **What is Hyperparameter Tuning?**

  - Hyperparameter tuning, also known as hyperparameter optimization, is the process of finding the best set of hyperparameters for a machine learning model.
  

- **Why is Hyperparameter Tuning Important?**
  - The performance of a machine learning model is highly dependent on the choice of hyperparameters.
  
### Automatic Model Tuning Best Practices

When tuning your machine learning model automatically, follow these best practices:

#### 2. Restrict Parameter Ranges
- **Rule:** Keep parameter ranges as narrow as possible.
- **Explanation:** Focusing on specific values enhances the efficiency of the tuning process.

#### 3. Logarithmic Scales
- **Rule:** Use logarithmic scales when appropriate.
- **Explanation:** Logarithmic scaling helps explore a wide range of values, especially for parameters with large value ranges.

#### 4. Manage Concurrent Jobs
- **Rule:** Limit the number of simultaneous training jobs.
- **Explanation:** Running too many jobs concurrently may hinder the learning process. Opt for a balanced approach.

#### 5. Ensure Metric Consistency
- **Rule:** Confirm consistent reporting of objective metrics across multiple instances.
- **Explanation:** Accurate metrics ensure reliable evaluation of model performance, especially when utilizing multiple computing instances.

Remember, these practices contribute to a more effective and efficient automatic model tuning process.
