## Different Levels of Openness in Large Language Models (LLMs)

Large language models (LLMs) vary in openness, ranging from fully open-source to partially open models. Below are the main categories:

### Fully Open-Source LLMs

These models share all aspects, including code, weights, and training data under permissive licenses.

**Examples:**
- **BLOOM**: A 176-billion parameter multilingual model supporting 46 natural languages and 13 programming languages.
- **GPT-NeoX and GPT-J**: Developed by EleutherAI, with 20 billion and 6 billion parameters respectively.

### Open-Weight LLMs

These models disclose the model weights but may not share the training data or full architecture.

**Examples:**
- **LLaMA 3.1**: Meta AI's model with variants ranging from 8 billion to 405 billion parameters.
- **Falcon 180B**: Developed by Technology Innovation Institute (TII), recognized for its performance in the open-source community.

### Open-Architecture LLMs

These models share the architecture but may keep the weights and training data proprietary.

**Example:**
- **OPT (Open Pretrained Transformer)**: A suite of decoder-only pre-trained transformers ranging from 125M to 175B parameters.

### Partially Open LLMs

These models may have some components open while others remain proprietary.

**Example:**
- **XGen-7B**: Developed by Salesforce, with most variants available for commercial and research purposes, except for specific instructional data-trained versions.



##  Level of Archticting


- Conceptual — a high level diagram that is used to communicate to key stakeholders the business solution we are implementing
    
- Logical — a mid level diagram that describes the key technical components but not requiring detailed parameters so we can quickly rearchitect and communicate to our technical team the current workload
    
    .Physical — a low level diagram that details all possible parameters and connections used by engineers/developers to accurately implement a solution (e.g. ARNs for resources, IP addresses, etc)**
