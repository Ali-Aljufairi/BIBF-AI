### Pandas 
 Pandas is a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and data manipulation library built on top of the Python programming language.

  - **Data Frame**: A two-dimensional data structure, i.e., data is aligned in a tabular fashion in rows and columns.
  
  - **Series**: A one-dimensional labeled array capable of holding data of any type (integer, string, float, python objects, etc.). The axis labels are collectively called index.
  
    - **Panel**: A three-dimensional data structure, i.e., data is aligned in a tabular fashion in rows, columns and panels.
