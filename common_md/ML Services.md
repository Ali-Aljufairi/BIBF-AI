### Amazon Polly Overview

Amazon Polly is a powerful Neural Text-to-Speech (TTS) service that offers a wide range of voices and supports multiple languages. It provides various features to enhance the quality and customization of synthesized speech.

#### Neural Text-To-Speech

Amazon Polly utilizes Neural TTS technology to produce natural and lifelike speech. It offers a diverse selection of voices in different languages, enabling users to create engaging and dynamic audio content.

#### Lexicons

Lexicons in Amazon Polly allow users to tailor the pronunciation of specific words and phrases. This customization ensures accurate and contextually appropriate rendering of terms, such as replacing "W3C" with "World Wide Web Consortium."

#### SSML (Speech Synthesis Markup Language)

SSML is an integral part of Amazon Polly, providing an alternative to plain text input. This markup language gives users fine-grained control over various aspects of speech synthesis, including emphasis, pronunciation, breathing, whispering, speech rate, pitch, and pauses.

#### Speech Marks

Amazon Polly supports the encoding of speech marks, indicating the start and end of sentences or words in the audio stream. This feature is particularly useful for applications like lip-synching animation, where precise synchronization with speech is crucial.
