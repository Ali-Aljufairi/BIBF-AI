# Exploratory Data Analysis

## Python

### Pandas 
 Pandas is a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and data manipulation library built on top of the Python programming language.

  - **Data Frame**: A two-dimensional data structure, i.e., data is aligned in a tabular fashion in rows and columns.
  
  - **Series**: A one-dimensional labeled array capable of holding data of any type (integer, string, float, python objects, etc.). The axis labels are collectively called index.
  
  - **Panel**: A three-dimensional data structure, i.e., data is aligned in a tabular fashion in rows, columns and panels.
    


### Matplotlib

 Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.

  - **Line Plot**: A line plot is a graph that shows frequency of data along a number line.
  
  - **Bar Plot**: A bar plot is a graph that represents the category of data with rectangular bars.
  
  - **Histogram**: A histogram is a graph showing frequency distributions.
  
  - **Scatter Plot**: A scatter plot is a graph that shows the relationship between two sets of data.
  
  - **Pie Chart**: A pie chart is a circular statistical graphic, which is divided into slices to illustrate numerical proportion.
  
  - **Box Plot**: A box plot is a graph that gives you a good indication of how the values in the data are spread out.
  
  - **Violin Plot**: A violin plot is a method of plotting numeric data and can be considered a combination of the box plot with a kernel density plot.
  
  - **Heat Map**: A heat map is a graphical representation of data where the individual values contained in a matrix are represented as colors.
  
  - **3D Plot**: A 3D plot is a graph that shows the relationship between three sets of data.
  
  - **Contour Plot**: A contour plot is a graphical technique for representing a 3-dimensional surface by plotting constant z slices, called contours, on a 2-dimensional format.
  
  - **Quiver Plot**: A quiver plot is a type of 2D plot that shows vector lines as arrows.
  
  - **Stream Plot**: A stream plot is a type of 2D plot that shows vector field.
  
  - **Polygon Plot**: A polygon plot is a type of 2D plot that shows a filled polygon.
  
  - **Image Plot**: An image plot is a type of 2D plot that shows an image.
  
  - **Polar Plot**: A polar plot is a type of 2D plot that shows data in polar coordinates.
  
  - **3D Surface Plot**: A 3D surface plot is a type of 3D plot that shows a surface.
  
  
  - **3D Bar Plot

## Major Types of Data 

### Numerical  
  - **Discrete**: Discrete data can only take particular values. There may potentially be an infinite number of those values, but each is distinct and there's no grey area in between. 
  - **Continuous**: Continuous data can take any value within a given range.

### Categorical

  - **Quantitative**: Quantitative data is data expressing a certain quantity, amount or range. Usually, there are measurement units associated with the data.

  - **Nominal**: Nominal data is a group of non-parametric variables, that is, variables that do not follow a regular distribution.
  
### Time Series
  
  - **Cross-Sectional**: Cross-sectional data is data collected by observing many subjects (such as individuals, firms, countries, or regions) at the same point of time, or without regard to differences in time.
  - **Time Series**: Time series data is a sequence of data points in chronological order, such as daily closing stock prices or monthly temperatures.
