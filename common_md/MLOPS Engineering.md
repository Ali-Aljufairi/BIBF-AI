### Why does ML workloads not make it to production?

It might be because a lot of the focus when designing and implementing an ML workload is on the function of the model. The focus is on getting the model to work in a development environment. There is often less focus on operating the model and making it accessible and reliable for users after it is trained.

### Consideration for MLOps


1. **Consisitency**:  use the same tools and processes for training, deploying, and monitoring models.

1. **Reproducibility**:  ensure that the results of a model can be reproduced.

1. **Scalability**:  scale the model to handle the expected load.

1. **Auditability**:  track the lineage of the model and the data used to train it.


### Why ML governance

### Sage Maker

> Important to know  BYOC (Bring Your Own Container) and BYOM (Bring Your Own Model) are two important concepts in Amazon SageMaker. BYOC allows you to use your own Docker container to train and deploy models in Amazon SageMaker. BYOM allows you to use your own machine learning model to train and deploy models in Amazon SageMaker.

### AWS Reliable MLOps Monitoring 

1. **Model Drift Detection**: One of the key aspects of AWS Reliable MLOps Monitoring is detecting model drift. Model drift occurs when the statistical properties of the input data or the relationship between the input data and target variable change over time, leading to a degradation in the model's performance. AWS Reliable MLOps Monitoring helps identify these drifts by continuously monitoring the input data, model predictions, and other relevant metrics.

2. **Data Quality Monitoring**: Another crucial aspect is monitoring the quality of the input data used for making predictions. AWS Reliable MLOps Monitoring helps identify issues such as data drift (changes in the distribution of input data), missing values, outliers, and other data quality problems that can negatively impact the model's performance.

3. **Performance Monitoring**: AWS Reliable MLOps Monitoring also involves monitoring the performance of the deployed ML models in production. This includes tracking metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and other relevant performance indicators to ensure that the models are meeting the desired performance levels.

4. **Automated Retraining and Deployment**: In cases where model drift or performance degradation is detected, AWS Reliable MLOps Monitoring can trigger automated retraining and deployment processes. This ensures that the ML models are updated and optimized to maintain their performance and accuracy over time.

5. **Explainability and Bias Monitoring**: AWS Reliable MLOps Monitoring also focuses on monitoring the explainability and fairness of ML models. It helps identify potential biases and ensures that the models are making decisions in a transparent and unbiased manner.

6. **Operational Monitoring**: In addition to monitoring the ML models themselves, AWS Reliable MLOps Monitoring also includes operational monitoring of the underlying infrastructure, such as computing resources, storage, and networking components, to ensure the smooth and reliable operation of the ML systems.

The importance of AWS Reliable MLOps Monitoring lies in its ability to maintain the reliability, accuracy, and performance of ML models in production environments. Without proper monitoring and management, ML models can quickly become outdated or biased, leading to suboptimal or even harmful decision-making. By incorporating AWS Reliable MLOps Monitoring into the MLOps workflow, organizations can ensure that their ML systems remain reliable, efficient, and trustworthy over time.


## Summary  Achieving MLOps Maturity with AWS: A Guide to Streamlining Machine Learning Operations

Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) is an emerging discipline that aims to bridge the gap between data science and software engineering, enabling organizations to efficiently deploy, manage, and maintain machine learning (ML) models in production environments. In this blog post, we'll explore the key concepts and best practices for achieving MLOps maturity using Amazon Web Services (AWS) and its powerful tools, such as Amazon SageMaker.

The Journey to MLOps Maturity
AWS outlines four levels of MLOps maturity: initial, repeatable, reliable, and scalable. Each level represents a progressive step towards a more streamlined and efficient ML workflow.

1. Initial MLOps: At this stage, data science and IT teams work in silos, with limited collaboration and cross-training. Data processing, model training, and deployment are primarily manual processes.

2. Repeatable MLOps: This phase marks the beginning of true MLOps adoption. Teams start collaborating with shared goals, automating data pipelines, and establishing defined paths for model experimentation and deployment.

3. Reliable MLOps: Cross-functional teams emerge, with improved data governance, integrated ML pipelines, and automated model validation. Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipelines are implemented, along with monitoring and logging for models, workloads, and pipelines.

4. Scalable MLOps: At the pinnacle of MLOps maturity, organizations establish well-defined processes, share best practices, and leverage templatization to speed up new solution development. Customized SageMaker project templates enforce organizational standards and automate the creation of secure MLOps environments.

Building MLOps into Your ML Solutions
To raise your organization's MLOps maturity level, AWS recommends the following approaches:

1. Start small and iterate: Gradually introduce MLOps practices into your existing workflows, rather than attempting a complete overhaul.

2. Embrace "everything-as-code": Adopt an infrastructure-as-code approach to ensure repeatability, consistency, and governance across your ML pipelines.

3. Leverage ML-specific inputs, outputs, and artifacts: Maintain lineage for models, data, and pipelines to enable traceability and reproducibility.

4. Integrate SageMaker features and services: Utilize SageMaker's built-in capabilities, such as the Model Registry and Feature Store, to streamline model management and feature engineering.

5. Implement a Model Registry: Centralize model management, versioning, and deployment within your ML pipelines.

6. Explore the Feature Store: Store, share, and manage ML model features for training and inference, improving collaboration and reusability.

By following these guidelines and leveraging AWS's powerful MLOps tools, organizations can achieve a higher level of maturity, streamlining their ML operations and maximizing the value derived from their data and models.
