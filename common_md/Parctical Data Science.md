### Common ML use cases

 - **Classification**: Predicting a category
 - **Regression**: Predicting a number
 - **Clustering**: Finding groups in data
 - **Anomaly detection**: Finding outliers


### ML model benefits

- **identify patterns**: ML models can identify patterns in data that humans can't

- **Minimize human error**: ML models can make predictions without human intervention

- **Can become more accurate over time**: ML models can learn from new data and improve their predictions

- **variety of data**: ML models can handle a variety of data types, including images, text, and numbers
