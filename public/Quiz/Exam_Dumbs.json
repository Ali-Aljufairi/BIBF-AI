    "question": "A company that runs an online library is implementing a chatbot using Amazon Lex to provide book recommendations based on category. This intent is fulfilled by an AWS Lambda function that queries an Amazon DynamoDB table for a list of book titles, given a particular category. For testing, there are only three categories implemented as the custom slot types: \"comedy,\" \"adventure,` and \"documentary.`A machine learning (ML) specialist notices that sometimes the request cannot be fulfilled because Amazon Lex cannot understand the category spoken by users with utterances such as \"funny,\" \"fun,\" and \"humor.\" The ML specialist needs to fix the problem without changing the Lambda code or data in DynamoDB.How should the ML specialist fix the problem?",
    "answers": [
      "A. Add the unrecognized words in the enumeration values list as new values in the slot type.",
      "B. Create a new custom slot type, add the unrecognized words to this slot type as enumeration values, and use this slot type for the slot.",

    "question": "A manufacturing company uses machine learning (ML) models to detect quality issues. The models use images that are taken of the company's product at the end of each production step. The company has thousands of machines at the production site that generate one image per second on average.The company ran a successful pilot with a single manufacturing machine. For the pilot, ML specialists used an industrial PC that ran AWS IoT Greengrass with a long-running AWS Lambda function that uploaded the images to Amazon S3. The uploaded images invoked a Lambda function that was written in Python to perform inference by using an Amazon SageMaker endpoint that ran a custom model. The inference results were forwarded back to a web service that was hosted at the production site to prevent faulty products from being shipped.The company scaled the solution out to all manufacturing machines by installing similarly configured industrial PCs on each production machine. However, latency for predictions increased beyond acceptable limits. Analysis shows that the internet connection is at its capacity limit.How can the company resolve this issue MOST cost-effectively?",
    "answers": [
      "A. Set up a 10 Gbps AWS Direct Connect connection between the production site and the nearest AWS Region. Use the Direct Connect connection to upload the images. Increase the size of the instances and the number of instances that are used by the SageMaker endpoint.",
      "B. Extend the long-running Lambda function that runs on AWS IoT Greengrass to compress the images and upload the compressed files to Amazon S3. Decompress the files by using a separate Lambda function that invokes the existing Lambda function to run the inference pipeline.",
      "C. Use auto scaling for SageMaker. Set up an AWS Direct Connect connection between the production site and the nearest AWS Region. Use the Direct Connect connection to upload the images.",
      "D. Deploy the Lambda function and the ML models onto the AWS IoT Greengrass core that is running on the industrial PCs that are installed on each machine. Extend the long-running Lambda function that runs on AWS IoT Greengrass to invoke the Lambda function with the captured images and run the inference on the edge component that forwards the results directly to the web service."

    "question": "A bank wants to launch a low-rate credit promotion. The bank is located in a town that recently experienced economic hardship. Only some of the bank's customers were affected by the crisis, so the bank's credit team must identify which customers to target with the promotion. However, the credit team wants to make sure that loyal customers' full credit history is considered when the decision is made.The bank's data science team developed a model that classifies account transactions and understands credit eligibility. The data science team used the XGBoost algorithm to train the model. The team used 7 years of bank transaction historical data for training and hyperparameter tuning over the course of several days.The accuracy of the model is sufficient, but the credit team is struggling to explain accurately why the model denies credit to some customers. The credit team has almost no skill in data science.What should the data science team do to address this issue in the MOST operationally efficient manner?",
